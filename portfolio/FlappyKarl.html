            <h1 style="text-align: center">A Mobile Obstacle-Dodging Game in Unity </h1>
            A simple 2D game made in Unity and published to the Google Play Store. In Flappy Karl, play as everyone's favourite floating head: Karl! Dodge pipes to accumulate points and try your best to set new personal records.

                <br/>
                With limited artistic ability and sparse assets, I wanted to create a mobile app that required few assets but offered infinite replayability (no storyline involved). And so, I drew inspiration from an app that was trending at the time that fit my aforementioned criteria.

            <h3>A Lone Flying Head</h3>

                <br/>
                All of the sprites presented in this game were created/edited by me. Additionally, the sound effects were gathered from royalty-free sources and the leading man himself: Karl. In this image we can see the soon-to-be doom of our main character, as he treads closely to a pipe after dodging a meager amount of obstacles (displayed by the 1 at the top).
