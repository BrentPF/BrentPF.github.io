            <h1 style="text-align: center"> A 2D Platformer in Unity </h1>
            A simple 2D platformer-style game made with the Unity Game Engine, along with its Unity Scripting API and C#. The game has no clear objective (currently), and is mainly for exploring the capabilities of the game engine.
            <h3>Running and Jumping</h3>

                Sprites in this game were acquired from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a> or were created by me. Here we can see the animation transitions and colliders also working well.

            <h3>Attacking and Enemy Destruction</h3>

                Hit colliders perfectly tuned for the bodies of the golems and the sword swing radius! The 2-part default attack for the MC also working nicely.
