          <h3>Java</h3>
          <p>A language that I've gained experience with mainly through university coursework. With this language I am able to implement pseudo-code, work with multiple classes, and create solutions for programming challenges.</p>

          <h3>C, C++, C#</h3>
          <p>The C languages are among the very first I've worked with. My knowledge and experience varies for each of these languages, but I'm capable of implementing pseudo-code with each, along with utilizing some of their language-specific libraries and techniques to solve problems.</p>

          <h3>Git, Unity, Bash, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks</h3>
          <p>I use the above softwares for various purposes. Git for version control of my ongoing projects, and also just to store any other projects I want stored. Unity for game development, along with Visual Studio for writing scripts. Code::Blocks for general purpose programming in C++.</p>
