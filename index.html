          <h3>Java</h3>
          <p>A language that I've gained experience with mainly through university coursework. With this language I am able to implement pseudo-code, work with multiple classes, and create solutions for programming challenges.</p>

          <h3>C, C++, C#</h3>
          <p>The C languages are among the very first I've worked with. My knowledge and experience varies for each of these languages, but I'm capable of implementing pseudo-code with each, along with utilizing some of their language-specific libraries and techniques to solve problems.</p>
